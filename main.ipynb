    "Formula 1 is widely regarded as the pinnacle of motorsport, yet the excitement level of each Grand Prix can vary dramatically. Some races unfold as predictable processions, while others deliver unexpected chaos, dramatic overtakes, and major shifts in championship momentum. This inconsistency makes it difficult for casual viewers to decide which races are worth watching, and even dedicated fans often gravitate toward events that promise high action. Predicting that excitement before a race begins, however, is far from straightforward. The dynamics that shape a race’s entertainment value — grid order, competitive pressure, track layout, and environmental conditions — all interact in complex ways that are not immediately obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the narrative surrounding a race before it happens has become almost as influential as the race itself. Tight championship battles, surprising qualifying results, unusual track environments, or major penalties can all heighten expectations for an unpredictable event. Although excitement is inherently subjective, many measurable factors correlate with how action-packed a race turns out to be. Metrics such as overtakes, retirements, and field spread provide concrete signals of how dynamic a race was. These relationships motivate our central goal: to build a machine learning classifier capable of predicting a race’s entertainment value *strictly* from ***pre-race information***.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this, we draw on historical Formula 1 data spanning 1950–2024, focusing on features that can be known before lights out — including qualifying performance, driver standings, and circuit characteristics. We then generate an objective “excitement” label using post-race metrics such as DNFs and total overtakes. This allows us to train and evaluate our model without introducing future information into the predictions. By combining pre-race context with well-defined labels, our project investigates whether it is possible to anticipate the entertainment potential of a Grand Prix ahead of time. Such a model can help casual fans choose which races to watch live and may provide broader insight into how pre-race conditions shape the dynamics of Formula 1 competition."

    "Research on predicting the entertainment value of sporting events has grown a lot in recent years, especially in football, basketball, and various motorsports. Most of that work, however, focuses on performance outcomes — things like predicting the race winner, estimating lap times, or modeling podium finishes. In Formula 1 specifically, there’s been work using historical timing data to estimate pace differences, applying machine learning to forecast pit strategies, or studying how track layout affects overtaking. These kinds of projects show that many aspects of a race can be anticipated using pre-race information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Formula 1, several Kaggle notebooks and independent analyses have also looked at how overtakes relate to circuit characteristics, how altitude or temperature impacts power units, and how qualifying gaps influence race-day competitiveness. A lot of these takeaways point toward similar themes: grid variability, championship pressure, and track features all play meaningful roles in shaping how a race plays out — which aligns with the features we build into our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s much less common is trying to classify the overall “excitement” of a race as its own prediction task. The few attempts that exist usually rely on fan surveys or subjective scoring systems, which can be inconsistent and hard to scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach differs in two important ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective Labeling**:\n",
    "- Instead of using opinions or ratings, we define excitement using measurable post-race metrics like DNFs and overtakes. This gives us a consistent, reproducible label.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strictly Pre-Race Features**:\n",
    "- We only use information available before the race starts, which helps avoid data leakage — something not all prior work accounts for.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining insights from motorsport analytics with this stricter setup, our project pushes into a relatively under-explored space: trying to predict how entertaining a Formula 1 race will be before anyone has turned a wheel."

    "Grid shake-up measures how unusual the starting grid is compared to each driver’s typical qualifying performance that season. Higher shake-up values mean more drivers are starting far from where they “normally” qualify (e.g., a top driver starting P12, or a midfield driver unexpectedly lining up P5).\n",
    "\n",
    "The KDE plot below compares the distribution of shake-up between exciting and non-exciting races:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both groups peak around 2.0–2.5, meaning most races involve some moderate amount of qualifying variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The curve for exciting races is slightly shifted to the right, showing more density between 2.5–4.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This suggests that exciting races tend to have a bit more qualifying chaos — cars starting out of position, which naturally leads to more overtaking and more dynamic race scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the difference between the two distributions is subtle, it aligns with Formula 1 intuition: When the grid is mixed up, the race is usually more eventful. However, the heavy overlap also makes it clear that qualifying shake-up is not the sole source of excitement — many unpredictable factors on race day (weather, crashes, safety cars, tyre issues) can overshadow what happens on Saturday.\n",
